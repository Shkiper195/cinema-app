                                But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure 
                                and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, 
                                and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the 
                                master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids 
                                pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who 
                                do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences 
                                that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues 
                                or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because 
                                occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some 
                                great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious 
                                physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any 
                                right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no 
                                annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant 
                                pleasure?
